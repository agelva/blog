Once again we celebrate Memorial Day in the USA.

A very special day, dedicated to remembering and honoring all those men and women in uniform that fought for freedom. Freedom that nowadays - in most cases - is taken for granted.

A personal **thank you** to all of those that paid the ultimate price, with their life, so that my family, myself, my neighbors, my co-patriots can enjoy what we have today: our freedom.
